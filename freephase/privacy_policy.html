            <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
            <p>For FreePhase Price Tracker</p>
        </header>

        <p><strong>Effective Date:</strong> 27 January 2026</p>

        <p>
            This Privacy Policy explains how L. Venturini ("we," "us," or "our") handles information in connection with our Android application, FreePhase Price Tracker (the "App").
        </p>

        <h2>1. Information We Collect</h2>
        <p>The App is designed to be simple and privacy-focused. We collect very little information from you.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <strong>User Preferences:</strong> To provide a personalized experience, the App saves your selected region and your in-app purchase status (e.g., whether you have paid to remove ads). This information is stored exclusively on your device using Android's SharedPreferences and is never transmitted to us or any third party.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Third-Party Advertising Data:</strong> The App uses Google AdMob to display advertisements. Google may collect data to provide personalized ads. This may include your device's advertising ID, IP address, and information about your interactions with ads. You can learn more about how Google handles data in their <a href="https://policies.google.com/technologies/ads" target="_blank">Advertising Privacy Policy</a>.
            </li>
        </ul>

        <h2>2. How We Use Your Information</h2>
        <p>The information collected is used solely for the following purposes:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>To save your settings and preferences within the App on your device.</li>
            <li>To display advertisements that help support the development of the App.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>3. Data Sharing and Third-Party Services</h2>
        <p>We do not share your personal information with any third parties, with the following exceptions:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <strong>Google AdMob:</strong> As our advertising provider, Google has access to the data it collects to serve ads.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Google Play Billing:</strong> If you choose to make an in-app purchase to remove ads, the transaction is processed securely by the Google Play Store. We do not receive or store any of your financial information, such as credit card numbers.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>EnergyPrice.uk:</strong> The App fetches price data from the public website energyprice.uk. This process involves a standard internet request from your device to their servers. Your IP address may be visible to this service as part of this standard request, but no other personal data is sent.
            </li>
        </ul>

        <h2>4. In-App Purchases</h2>
        <p>The App offers a one-time in-app purchase to permanently disable advertisements. This purchase is handled by the Google Play Store. Your purchase history is managed by your Google Account.</p>

        <h2>5. Children's Privacy</h2>
        <p>The App is not directed at children under the age of 13. We do not knowingly collect any personal information from children. If you believe your child has provided us with information, please contact us, and we will take steps to delete it.</p>

        <h2>6. Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>
        <p>We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify you of any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy on this page. You are advised to review this Privacy Policy periodically for any changes.</p>
