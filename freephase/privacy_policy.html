            <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
            <p>For PhaseTrack</p>
        </header>

        <p><strong>Effective Date:</strong> 17 February 2026</p>

        <p>
            This Privacy Policy explains how Energy Trackers ("we," "us," or "our") collects, uses and shares information in connection with our Android application, PhaseTrack (the "App").
        </p>

        <h2>1. Information We Collect</h2>
        <p>We value your privacy. The App is designed to be simple and privacy-focused. We collect limited information from you.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <strong>User Preferences:</strong> To provide a personalized experience, the App saves your selected region and your in-app purchase status (e.g., whether you have paid to remove ads). This information is stored exclusively on your device using Android's SharedPreferences and is never transmitted to us or any third party.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Device and Technical Information:</strong> When you use our App, we may automatically collect certain technical information from your device, such as your IP address, device model, operating system version, unique device identifiers (including Android Advertising ID), and mobile network information. This data is used for analytics, crash reporting, and to serve advertisements.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Analytics Data (Firebase Analytics):</strong> The App uses Google Firebase Analytics to understand how the App is used and to improve performance and features. Firebase Analytics may collect information such as app interaction events (e.g., screens viewed, button taps), basic device information, and approximate location inferred from your IP address. This analytics data is processed by Google as a service provider.
                You can learn more here: <a href="https://firebase.google.com/support/privacy" target="_blank">Firebase Privacy and Security</a> and <a href="https://policies.google.com/privacy" target="_blank">Google Privacy Policy</a>.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Crash Logs (Firebase Crashlytics):</strong> We use Firebase Crashlytics to collect crash reports. These reports help us fix bugs and improve stability. They may contain information about your device state at the time of the crash.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Notification Permission:</strong> If you enable notifications on Android 13 or later, the system may ask for permission to post notifications. The App uses this permission only to show alerts about free electricity periods; no permission-related data is sent to us.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Third-Party Advertising Data:</strong> The App uses Google AdMob to display advertisements. Google may collect data to provide personalized ads. This may include your device's advertising ID, IP address, and information about your interactions with ads. You can learn more about how Google handles data in their <a href="https://policies.google.com/technologies/ads" target="_blank">Advertising Privacy Policy</a>.
            </li>
        </ul>

        <h2>2. How We Use Your Information</h2>
        <p>The information collected is used solely for the following purposes:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>To save your settings and preferences within the App on your device.</li>
            <li>To understand App usage and improve the App’s performance and features (analytics).</li>
            <li>To display advertisements that help support the development of the App.</li>
            <li>To send optional notifications about free electricity periods, when enabled.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>3. Data Sharing and Third-Party Services</h2>
        <p>We do not share your personal information with any third parties, with the following exceptions:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <strong>Google Firebase Analytics:</strong> The App uses Firebase Analytics to measure and understand App usage. Analytics data is processed by Google. See: <a href="https://firebase.google.com/support/privacy" target="_blank">Firebase Privacy and Security</a>.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Google AdMob:</strong> As our advertising provider, Google has access to the data it collects to serve ads.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Google Play Billing:</strong> If you choose to make an in-app purchase to remove ads, the transaction is processed securely by the Google Play Store. We do not receive or store any of your financial information, such as credit card numbers.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>EDF open API:</strong> The App fetches price data from EDF's open API, including background checks around 17:00 UK time for next-day prices. This process involves a standard internet request from your device to their servers. Your IP address may be visible to this service as part of this standard request, but no other personal data is sent.
            </li>
        </ul>

        <h2>4. In-App Purchases</h2>
        <p>The App offers a one-time in-app purchase to permanently disable advertisements. This purchase is handled by the Google Play Store. Your purchase history is managed by your Google Account.</p>

        <h2>5. Children's Privacy</h2>
        <p>The App is not directed at children under the age of 13. We do not knowingly collect any personal information from children. If you believe your child has provided us with information, please contact us, and we will take steps to delete it.</p>

        <h2>6. Data Retention</h2>
        <p>We retain your personal data only for as long as is necessary for the purposes set out in this Privacy Policy.</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Analytics Data:</strong> Data associated with cookies, user identifiers, or advertising identifiers is retained by Google Analytics for a period of 14 months before being automatically deleted.</li>
            <li><strong>Crash Reports:</strong> Crash data is retained by Firebase Crashlytics for 90 days.</li>
            <li><strong>Advertising Data:</strong> Google advertising cookies and identifiers expire after a set period (typically 13 months) unless you interact with our services again.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>If you withdraw your consent or request deletion, we will delete your data from our systems unless we have a legal obligation to keep it.</p>
